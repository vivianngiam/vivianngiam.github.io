            <div class="type-casestudy-body">Having a strained relationship with my family, one of the rare ways I connect with my family is through cooking, food and family recipes. Moving across the world to the U.S. alone has also sparked my desire to preserve my Singaporean culture. Despite some parts of my culture I wish to leave behind, Singaporean food is something I very strongly relate to and claim as mine. Hence, the goal of this installation was to  explore the nuances between an immigrant’s identity, home, sense of belonging through the power of evoking memories through food and cooking.<br><br>This installation was exhibited at a 2-day exhibition with a foot traffic of over a thousand people each day. It was created with the constraints of this exhibition in mind.</div><img src="images/exhibition-interaction-cooking.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 94vw, (max-width: 991px) 75vw, 690px" srcset="images/exhibition-interaction-cooking-p-500.png 500w, images/exhibition-interaction-cooking-p-800.png 800w, images/exhibition-interaction-cooking-p-1080.png 1080w, images/exhibition-interaction-cooking-p-1600.png 1600w, images/exhibition-interaction-cooking.png 1678w" alt="">

            <div class="type-casestudy-body">I came up with the general final concept: Using “ingredient cards” to show the 3D model of the ingredient in mobile AR and a memory portal which shows Grandma teaching me how to cook that particular ingredient.<br>‍</div>

            <div class="type-casestudy-body"><br>There were some limitations of using Lens Studio, mainly the 8MB total project assets limit. Using video is very asset heavy and I would have to work around that to ensure all the videos are able to fit the size limit while still being able to tell the story. Another limitation would be that image tracking will only work for one image at a time, so interaction design would have to take this into account.<br>‍<br></div>

            <div class="type-casestudy-body"><br>Plate test: The interaction cards needed something else to ground them in the physical reality so I decided to test it out with a plate and tested with users. Many liked that they could see 3D food in the physical plate and that it was a good use of AR. Some did point out that the picture cutout of the food in the plate was a little distracting and or conflicting with the 3D food.<br><br>Hence, I designed a token, laser cut it and tested its image tracking capabilities since it’s technically not an image.<br></div>

            <div class="type-casestudy-body">I wanted the memory cube to play when the user approaches the cube. However, it didn’t feel intuitive enough after doing some initial testing with people, especially those with little AR experience. Hence, I changed this interaction to tap to play the memory cube with instructions over the cube. However, after testing with new users, it still felt like a disconnect as now there was an added interaction on the device, conflicting with the viewing function of the device.<br></div>

Now, when people scan the Snap code, the rear camera is automatically activated so it doesn’t cause confusion and they are easily able to start engaging with the installation.<br><br>3) Have both Instagram and Snapchat for the take home “Made in Singapore” token where they can interact with it using the social AR platform that they have (more users had Instagram over Snapchat)<br><br></div><img src="images/exhibition-interaction-dinner-table.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 94vw, (max-width: 991px) 75vw, 690px" srcset="images/exhibition-interaction-dinner-table-p-500.png 500w, images/exhibition-interaction-dinner-table-p-800.png 800w, images/exhibition-interaction-dinner-table.png 942w" alt="">

Some visitors thought they were separate projects until I clarified that they were parts of the same project. Unfortunately, I was unable to change the layout on the second day due to exhibition constraints but if I could I would mark out the space using sheer curtains to clearly delineate the installation and have the only opening to the cooking table. This would guide users to come and interact with the cooking table first then the dinner table.</div>

            <div class="type-casestudy-body">This was an extremely successful exhibit and I received amazing feedback on the project. Many immigrants related to the experience and story. I am glad I was able to showcase a little of Singapore&#x27;s culture while tapping into my identity and exploring where or what home is to me. <br><br>I hope to continue working on this project and build upon the following elements:<br>‍<br>1) Add smell<br><br>2) Include additional dialogue of the food, smells, tastes, textures of the food from family members and embed them in the respective 3D dish (e.g. when the rice appears, the accompanying conversation around the rice will be played)<br><em><br>*Incorporate the cards on the dinner table into the experience more, possibly through this manner with translation as AR texts (I initially did not do this as I had to translate what my Grandma was saying and settled on the cards due to time constraints</em>‍</div>
            <div style="padding-top:56.17021276595745%" class="w-embed-youtubevideo"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9a1Swjwi90?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;pointer-events:auto" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" title="Card example"></iframe></div>
            <div class="type-caption">One of the cards on the dinner table - includes both translation of the audio and QR code to listen<br>‍‍<br>‍</div>
            <div class="type-casestudy-body"><em></em>3) Polish the video and making it a full circle with captions; current workaround was to add a circular mist and crop as much of the portrait video without cutting out the translation or essential visual elements.<br><br>4) Not a lot of people have Snapchat, could include an Instagram version although the project size is 5MB instead of 8MB which makes it challenging to fit all the video files.<br><br>5) Because of multiple people interacting with the installation at the same time, some might miss the narrative soundscape. To mitigate this, leaving a card of the narrative soundscape on each table for people to pick up and read is something I would like to test.<br><br>Looking forward, I hope to show this piece in future exhibitions with an ever-improving experience. (iteration and user experience never stops!)</div>
